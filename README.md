<p>Logistic Growth is a mathematical function that can be used in many scenarios, including forecasting growth of COVID-19 cases. Logistic Growth is characterized by increasing Growth in the beginning period, but a decreasing growth at a later stage, as you get closer to a maximum. For example, in the COVID-19 situation, this maximum limit would be the total number of people in the world or country, because when everybody is sick, Growth will diminish.</p>
